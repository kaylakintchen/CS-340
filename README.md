How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The benefit of a CRUD Module is that it is reusable since the same module can be used to connect to that database repeatedly. It also allows for easy maintenance considering the CRUD functions are localized to a single module. Modularized code makes the code easier to understand, test, and update.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I took an analytical approach and made sure to understand the problem before attempting to provide a solution. Especially when working with clients, I find it very important to not just understand the "what", but also the "why".


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design and implement solutions based on client requirements. At Grazioso Salvare, they needed a visual solution for a large amount of data and I was able to implement it for them.
